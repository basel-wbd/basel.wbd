# Hi there 👋 I'm Basel


Welcome to my github profile! Hope you enjoy your visit

I'm currently attending RIT (Rochester Institute of Technology) studying a BS in industrial engineering. for as long as I can remember I always loved tinkering with things, be that software or hardware. I love problem solving and the satisfaction it brings me and I hope to solve many more of said problems as long as I can.

# 🚀 About me

- 🌏 I'm based in the UAE
- 💻 Currently learning a wide array of technologies and skills, all the way from full stack to extremely low level languages and even some hardware
- 🇸🇾I'm originally from syria 💚
- 🌱 I'm extremely keen on exploring all kinds of problems and pieces of knowledge
- 🧪 I dream of one day hopefully becoming a prominent researcher in as many fields as I could dip my hands in (call it polymathy or whatever your heart desires)
